     Our lives were a complex tapestry, and our woven strands were only meant to intersect at a small number of points in the time-conceived whole. An embroidered starburst, a missed warp, a complicated <a href="tradition.html">notion</a> on the loom of time. We were always together, but meant to live our majorities apart, two golden threads wandering through a haunted textile life.
